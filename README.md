# Advanced Algorithms and Graph Mining
The repository contains our project for the exam Advanced Algorithms and Graph Mining.

In [main.py](https://github.com/JacopoBartoli/agm_algorithms/blob/master/main.py) we implemented and compare different implementations of algorithms for counting triangles in a graph and calculating the local clustering coefficient of a node in the graph.

In [Bartoli-Ravagli.ipynb](https://github.com/JacopoBartoli/agm_algorithms/blob/master/Bartoli-Ravagli.ipynb) we analyzed the COVID-19 italian spread data until 21st August 2020.
